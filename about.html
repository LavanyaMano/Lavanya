    <h1>About Me</h1>
    Hi, I am Lavanya Manoharan.I am a full stack web developer. Attended Awesome Inc Bootcamp (Fall-2016). Had rigorous training on web technologies with more than 500 hrs of coding practice.

    I first had experience in writing HTML scripts as a part of summer class when was in school at my home town. Then I had my first experience in learning programming languages just after completing school at a coding camp. After that I learned C, C++, DBMS as a part of curriculum while doing my undergrad in civil engineering. Thats when I started understanding about the programming languages.I learned few engineering related softwares like Auto-CAD, Archi-CAD, Staad-Pro. All these experience created my interest towards computers.
    I even attempted to learn R-programming and blender. I find myself attracted towards softwares more as I learn. 
    “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” Thus heard of bootcamp at right time and got into it. And thats my transition from engineering to web development.

    I said transition just as people say. I believe its not transition, its just upgradation. Learning programming upgraded me as better engineer, better in looking into known and unknown problems, attempting in learning new things.
